# HIVEmatrix

### TL;DR

- This is the code that powers [Scyne's "HIVE" front end](https://hive.scyne.com).
- Standing for "HEURISTIC INTELLIGENCE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT," _The HIVE Method_ is how they keep their ADHD in check.
- Obviously, none of this is necessary but it makes the server errors look cool.

### About

This is the code that makes up all of the status pages for _The HIVE_, Scyne's personal server that maintains their automations and cloud apps. An ever-evolving set of docker containers,  _The HIVE_ is Scyne's second brain and an essential part of the way they cope with ADHD, information/data addiction, and interpersonal communication issues.

---
### Scyne's goals

1. Dive headfirst into _The HIVE_, loading every aspect of their life into the system and becoming a better, more productive, and reliable person in the process.
2. Fully flesh out _The HIVE Method_ so that it can be easily explained with a proven record of success. (Maybe make a YouTube video?)
3. Create a custom Docker-Compose for anyone that wishes to easily deploy their own copy of _The HIVE's_ backends (aka, _"HIVEmind"_).

### Contributions

The HIVE method is Scyne's permutation of [Tiago Forte's concept of a "Second Brain."](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) It is powered by a custom-designed [Notion](https://www.notion.so) workspace, google calendar, and the [Monica CRM Platform](https://www.monicahq.com/), all wired together by a number of custom [n8n](https://n8n.io/) automations.

The error page text effect is code taken from [acupoftee's](https://codepen.io/acupoftee/pens/public) [Pure CSS Glitch Experiment (Twitch Intro WIP)](https://codepen.io/acupoftee/pen/WNbBxXq).

The  [Matrix Code](rezmason.github.io/matrix), and by proxy this repo, was forked from [Rezmason/matrix](https://github.com/Rezmason/matrix).
