			Hi there!
			I'm Ki Scyne and you have stumbled upon port 80 of my "Second Brain" backend called HIVEmind.
			HIVEmind is the data storage and information daemon that powers "The HIVE" as well as performs a few other persistant tasks.
			Standing for "HEURISTIC INTELLIGENCE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT," The HIVE System is how I keep my ADHD in check.

			Here's some information about what a "Second Brain" is = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ssUVyfn5g
			If you are interested in what I'm doing here, message me on twitter @KiScyne or through matrix @scyne:hive.scyne.com

			For more information on how The HIVE System works go to = https://docs.hive.scyne.com
